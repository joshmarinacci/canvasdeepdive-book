<h1>Mobile Devices and Performance Optimization</h1>

<div id="content">

<p>Now, let's talk about mobile devices and optimization. There is no mobile
version of canvas, there's just canvas. It's the same API on desktop and mobile
devices. Mobile devices are sometimes missing features, however, and are usually
slower; but the same could be true on older desktops and browsers. So whenever
you are making a canvas app it's important to consider performance and different
ways to optimize your code. </p>

<h3><a id="drawless">Draw Less</a></h3>

<p>The general mantra for performance is <i>draw less</i>.</p>

<p><b>don't draw hidden things</b>. If you have four screens of information but
only one is visible at a time, then don't draw the others. </p>

<p><b>use images instead of shapes</b>. If you have some graphic that won't ever
change or be scaled, then consider drawing it into an image at compile time
using something like photoshop. In general images can be drawn much faster to
the screen than vector artwork. This is especially true if you have some graphic
that will be repainted over and over again like a sprite in a game. </p>

<p><b>cache using offscreen canvases</b>. You can create new instance of the
canvas object at runtime that aren't visible on screen. You can use these
offscreen canvasas as a cache. When your app starts draw graphics into the
offscreen canvas then just copy that over and over again to draw it. This gives
you the same speed as using images over shapes, but you are generating these
images at runtime and could potentially change them if needed. </p>

<p><b>image stretching</b>. Since we are using images for lots of things
already, consider stretching them for effects. Most canvas implementations have
highly optimized code for scaling and cropping images so it should be quite
fast. There are also several versions of drawImage that let you draw subsections
of an image. With these apis you can do clever things like caching a bunch of
sprites into a single image, or wildly stretching images for funky effects.

<p><b>only redraw the part of the screen you need</b>. Depending on your app it
may be possible to just redraw part of the screen. For example, if I have a ball
bouncing around I don't need to erase and redraw the entire background. Instead
I just need to redraw where the ball is and where it was on the previous frame.
For some apps this could be a huge speedup. </p>

<p><b>Draw fewer frames</b> Now that you are drawing as little per frame as
possible try to draw fewer frames. To get smooth animation you might want to
draw 100fps, but most computers max out at a 60fps screen refresh rate. There's
no point in drawing more frames because the user will never see them. So how do
you sync up with the screen refresh? Mozilla and WebKit have experimental apis
to request that the browser call your code on the next screen refresh. This will
replace your call to setInterval or setTimeout. Now the browser is in charge of
giving you a consistent framerate, and it will ensure you don't go over 60fps.
It can also do smart things like lowering the framerate if the user switches to
a different tab. Mobile browsers are starting to implement this as well so
background apps will be throttled back, saving on battery life. </p>

<p><b>The best way to draw less is to not draw it at all.</b> If you have a
static background then move it out of canvas and draw it with just an image in
the browser. You can make the background of a canvas transparent so that a
background image will show through. If you have large images to move around you
may find they move faster and smoother by using CSS transitions rather than
doing it with javascript in the canvas. In general CSS transitions will be
faster because they are implemented in C rather than JS, but your mileage may
vary, so test test test. Speaking of which: Chrome and Mozilla have great tools
to help you debug and test your JavaScript. [names? examples?]</p>

<p><b>pixel aligned images</b>. One final tip, in some implementations images
and shapes will draw faster if they are draw on pixel boundaries. Some tests
show a 2 to 3x speedup [verify] on the ipad canvas impl if you pixel align your
sprites.</p>
