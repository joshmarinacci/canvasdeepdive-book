<h3><a id='cube'>Building A Sky</a></h3>

<p>For our hands on, we will create a new scene: a car that drives around on a large grassy plain under a starry sky.  This is adapted from a series of great blog posts by Jerome, who also created the template builder and tQuery, which is like JQuery, but for ThreeJS. (<a href='http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2012/05/21/sport-car-in-webgl/'>original series</a>.)</p>


<p>Start with a new template from <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.com/threejsboilerplatebuilder/">the template builder</a>. Now let's add a sky.  The easy way to make a sky is to just put sky pictures on the sides of a big cube. The trick is that we will put the rest of the world <i>inside</i> of the cube. We will start by loading up images into a single cube texture like this:</p>

<pre><code>//add skymap
//load sky images
var urls = [
    "images/sky1.png",
    "images/sky1.png",
    "images/sky1.png",
    "images/sky1.png",
    "images/sky1.png",
    "images/sky1.png",
];
var textureCube = THREE.ImageUtils.loadTextureCube(urls);</code></pre>

<p>The image <code>sky1.png</code> is included in the example code download.</p>

<p>Now we need a cube shader to draw it with standard uniforms (shader inputs.) Notice that we've set the <code>tCube</code> texture to be our texture.</p>

<pre><code>//setup the cube shader
var shader = THREE.ShaderUtils.lib["cube"];
var uniforms = THREE.UniformsUtils.clone(shader.uniforms);
uniforms['tCube'].texture = textureCube;
var material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
        fragmentShader : shader.fragmentShader,
        vertexShader   : shader.vertexShader,
        uniforms       : uniforms
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we need a cube geometry. Set the size to <code>10000</code>. This will be a big cube.  Now we add it to the scene. We set <code>flipSided</code> to true because a default cube has the texture drawn on the outside. In our case we are on the inside of the cube.</p>

<pre><code>//create a skybox
var size = 10000;
skyboxMesh = new THREE.Mesh( 
    new THREE.CubeGeometry(size,size,size),material);
//IMPORTANT!! draw on the inside instead of outside
skyboxMesh.flipSided = true; // you must have this or you won't see anything
scene.add(skyboxMesh);
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's add a light from the sun. Without a light we cannot not see anything.</p>

<pre><code>//add sunlight
var light = new THREE.SpotLight();
light.position.set(0,500,0);
scene.add(light);</code></pre>

<p>Here's what we've got so far:</p>

<p><img src="images/gl_sky.png"></p>

<h3><a id='ground'>Adding a Ground Plane</a></h3>

<p>Now we want a ground plane. First you need to load the grass image (<a href='http://www.tutorialsforblender3d.com/Textures/Grass/Grass_1.html'>original source</a>) as a texture. (The grass image is also included in the example code.) Set it to repeat in the x and y directions. The repeat values should be the same as the size of the texture, and usually should be a power of two (ex: 256).</p>

<pre><code>//add ground
var grassTex = THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture('images/grass.png');
grassTex.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
grassTex.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
grassTex.repeat.x = 256;
grassTex.repeat.y = 256;
var groundMat = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({map:grassTex});</code></pre>

<p>Next is the geometry. It is just a big plane in space. The size of the plane is 400 x 400 which is fairly large compared to the camera but very small relative to the size of the sky, which is set to 10000.</p>

<pre><code>var groundGeo = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(400,400);</code></pre>

<p>Now we can combine them into a mesh. Set <code>position.y</code> to -1.9 so
it will be below the torus. Set <code>rotation.x</code> to 90 degrees so the
ground will be horizontal (a plane is vertical by default.) If you can't see,
the plane try setting <code>doubleSided</code> to true. Planes only draw on a
single side by default.</p>

<pre><code>var ground = new THREE.Mesh(groundGeo,groundMat);
ground.position.y = -1.9; //lower it
ground.rotation.x = -Math.PI/2; //-90 degrees around the xaxis
//IMPORTANT, draw on both sides
ground.doubleSided = true;
scene.add(ground);</code></pre>

<p>Here's what it should look like now:</p>

<p><img src='images/gl_grass.png'/></p>

<h3><a id='car'>Adding a Car Model</a></h3>

<p>To replace the torus with a car we will load an external model, in this case
a very detailed model of a Bugatti Veyron created by <a
href='http://artist-3d.com/free_3d_models/dnm/model_disp.php?uid=1129'>Troyano
</a>. I got these from the <a
href='https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples'>ThreeJS examples
repo</a>. You can find them in the example code download. Since this model is in
a binary format rather than JSON, we will load it up using the
<code>THREE.BinaryLoader</code>.</p>

<pre><code>//load a car			
//IMPORTANT: be sure to use ./ or it may not load the .bin correctly
new THREE.BinaryLoader().load('./VeyronNoUv_bin.js', function(geometry) {
    var orange    = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial( { color: 0x995500, opacity: 1.0, transparent: false } );
    var mesh	= new THREE.Mesh( geometry, orange );
    mesh.scale.x = mesh.scale.y = mesh.scale.z = 0.05;
    scene.add( mesh );
    car = mesh;
});</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the material is a <code>MeshLambertMaterial</code> rather than the <code>MeshNormalMaterial</code> we used before.  This will give the car a nice solid color that is properly shaded based on the light (orange, in this case). This mesh is huge by default compared to the torus, so scale it down to 5%, then add it to the scene.</p>

<p>Here's what it looks like now:</p>

<p><img src='images/gl_car.png'></p>


<h3><a id='keyboard'>Keyboard Control</a></h3>

<p>Of course a car just sitting there is no fun. And it's too far away. Let's make it move.  Currently the <code>cameraControl</code> object is moving the camera around. Remove that and create a new <code>KeyboardState</code> object where the <code>cameraControl</code> object was initialized. You will need to import <code>vendor/threex/THREEx.KeyboardState.js</code> at the top of your page.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=&quot;vendor/threex/THREEx.KeyboardState.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<pre><code>// create a camera contol
//cameraControls	= new THREEx.DragPanControls(camera)
keyboard = new THREEx.KeyboardState();</code></pre>

<p>Now, go down to the <code>render()</code> function. The keyboard object will let us query the current state of the keyboard. To move the car around using the keyboard replace <code>cameraControls.update()</code> with this code:</p>

<pre><code>// update camera controls
//cameraControls.update();
if(keyboard.pressed("left")) {
    car.rotation.y += 0.1;
}
if(keyboard.pressed("right")) {
    car.rotation.y -= 0.1;
}
if(keyboard.pressed("up")) {
    car.position.z -= 1.0;
}
if(keyboard.pressed("down")) {
    car.position.z += 1.0;
}</code></pre>

<p>Now the car is "driveable" using the keyboard. Of course it doesn't look very realistic. The car can slide sideways. To fix it we need a vector to represent the current direction of the car. Add an <code>angle</code> variable and change the code to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>if(keyboard.pressed("left")) {
    car.rotation.y += 0.1;
    angle += 0.1;
}
if(keyboard.pressed("right")) {
    car.rotation.y -= 0.1;
    angle -= 0.1;
}
if(keyboard.pressed("up")) {
    car.position.z -= Math.sin(-angle);
    car.position.x -= Math.cos(-angle);
}
if(keyboard.pressed("down")) {
    car.position.z += Math.sin(-angle);
    car.position.x += Math.cos(-angle);
}</code></pre>


<h3><a id='next'>Next Steps</a></h3>

<p>That's it for this hands on. If you wish to continue working with this example, here are a few things you might want to add.</p>

<ul>
<li>Make the camera follow the car.</li>
<li>Make the car shiny. Look at the source to the original example that this was based on. [link].</li>
<li>Make the car stop when you reach the edge of the world.</li>
<li>Add the dot screen effect from the previous chapter to this scene.</li>
</ul>
